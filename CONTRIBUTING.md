# Contributing

All developers should feel welcome and encouraged to contribute to Soto.

As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

To contribute a feature or idea to Soto, submit an issue and fill in the template. If the request is approved, you or one of the members of the community can start working on it.

We use [Swift Format](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat) to ensure a standard formatting for all code in Soto. If you create a PR we run a script verifying the code conforms to this format. To be sure your code is compliant run `./scripts/sanity.sh` before you create your PR. This script runs a number of checks including running Swift Format and verifying all source files have the correct file header. 

If you find a security vulnerability, please contact <swift-aws-maintainers@googlegroups.com> and reach out on the soto-aws [slack](http://soto-aws.slack.com/) or the [**#aws**](https://discordapp.com/channels/431917998102675485/472522745067077632) channel on the Vapor Discord as soon as possible. We take these matters seriously.
